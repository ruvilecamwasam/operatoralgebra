# OperatorAlgebra

[Joseph J Hope](mailto:joseph.hope@anu.edu.au) & [Ruvi Lecamwasam](mailto:me@ruvi.blog)

This is a Mathematica package to perform symbolic algebra with operators such as usually appear in quantum mechanics. We hope that this will save you a lot of time, effort, and missing factors of two.

To get started, check out the [examples](/examples/toc/). We also have [documentation](/documentation/toc/).

Feel free to reach out with questions, comments, or suggestions.
