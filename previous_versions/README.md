# Previous versions

Here you can find previous versions of the `operatoralgebra` package.

## OperatorAlgebraMay15

The original version, written by Joseph Hope in May 2015. This corresponds to the *Base* functionality in the current package. 

It's available as a package `OperatorAlgebraMay15.m`, and a notebook `OperatorAlgebraMay15.nb` with documentation and examples.

This has documentation to some features that haven't yet been written up for OperatorAlgebraV2.

Some functions have been renamed or had their functionality slightly modified, so *OperatorAlgebraV2* is **not** backwards compatible with *OperatorAlgebraMay15*.
